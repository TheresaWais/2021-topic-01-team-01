steps:
  1. filter prism.exp, prism.cnv, prsim.achilles for NSCLC, SCLC, mesothelioma (prism.cl)
  (2. cleaning and Z-Transformation)
  3. define thresholds
    prism.exp: x>T1(hoch): overexpression
               x<T2(tief): downregulated
    prism.cnv: x>2 amplified
               x<2 deleted
    prism.achilles: smallest values
  4. use thresholds for all 3 lung cancer subtypes to find genetic features, which define subtypes
  5. Compare genetic features of the subtypes (scatter plots for all 3 datasets(results), subtypes-> different colours)
