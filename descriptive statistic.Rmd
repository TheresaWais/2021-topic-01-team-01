### Descriptive Statistic

## Prism.treat
# Drug Types barplot

```{r}
# create vector of disease.area entries
disease.areas = prism.treat$disease.area

# exclude NAs
clean.disease.area = na.exclude(disease.areas)

# determine length of vector #3944
length(clean.disease.area)

# determine entries #493
length(clean.disease.area)/8

# sequence of numbers from from 1 to 3944 in steps of 8
pick.8 = seq(1,3944, by=8)
pick.8

# select every eighth entry of disease.area vector
plot.disease = clean.disease.area[c(pick.8)]
plot.disease
```

# Creating the bar plot
```{r}
# create barplot of disease areas of drugs used for drug repurposing
barplot(table(plot.disease),
        xlab = "Disease area of drugs",
        ylab = "Amount of drugs for given disease areas",
        main = "Overview barplot of the original use of tested drugs",
        space = 2)
```

## Prism.snv
# Barplot Arten der Mutation
```{r}
# select columns of interest out of prism.snv
mutation.types = prism.snv[, "Variant_Type"]
mutation.class = prism.snv[, "Variant_Classification"]

# remove NAs
mutation.types.clean = na.exclude(mutation.types)
mutation.class.clean = na.exclude(mutation.class)

# Barplot Mutation Types
barplot(table(mutation.types.clean),
        xlab = "Mutation Types",
        ylab = "Counts",
        main = "Distribution of Mutations in given genes of Prism.snv")

# Barplot Mutation Classes
barplot(table(mutation.class.clean),
        xlab = "Mutation Classes",
        ylab = "Counts",
        main = "Distribution of Mutation Classes in given genes of Prism.snv")
```
