1 Correlation between applied drug and cytotoxic effect on all cancer cell lines
  - PCA of whole data set
  - Regression model 
    (Determine correaltion of disulfiram treatment on metallothionin expressing cells)
    
2 Correlation between applied drugs and cytotoxic effect on lung cancer cells
  - Can we separate lung cancer subtypes by Principal components / Do different lung cancer lubtypes show different drug sensitivity?
  - Which drugs inhibit lung cancer proliferation best?
  - Is cytotoxic effect dose dependent?
  - Does dose dependency correlate with drug class? (oncological-targeted / non-oncological / chemotherapeutics)
  
3 Can we define certain genetic features that define lung cancer subtypes?
  - Can we find overexpressed / downregulated genes?
  - Are gene copy numbers altered in certain cell lines?
  - Which genes are essential for cancer proliferation?

4 Is the sensitivity to certain drugs related to the genetic profile of lung cancer cells?
